Nope Bitches
Did the recursion problem on my own, because the old github link (check history)
was shit
I solved it
the only downside is now I gotta ask if probability has anything to do with
time complexity, because the recursion (at least on Windows Subsystem for Linux)
maxes out at around 2000 calls. The average call is between 1000 and 200 though.
Every 50 or so tests it fails, and I see that as an absolute win. 
Started like around March 1, Finished the generator three weeks later 3/20


Next Steps: I guess do the shitty Leetcode solver thing. How hard could it be
